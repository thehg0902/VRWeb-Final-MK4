      <h3>WHAT IMPACT DO VIRTUAL REALITY HAVE ON SOCIETY</h3>
      <p>Virtual and augmented reality can help people connect with each other and improve their communication skills. As well as provide the user with an amazing and detailed experience that any previously known device could not. Consequently, and obviously, this has an impact on society</p>
      <br>
      <h3>HOW ARE VIRTUAL REALITY CHANGING THE WORLD?</h3>
      <p>Maybe you are not even aware that there are already many changes in our lives that have been produced by these technologies. And, although for many, they still sound like something unknown, they have been among us for many years. And its impact is already noticeable in many aspects of everyday life.
        The effects of virtual and augmented reality in our society will be greater than one can think. For anyone who uses a mobile phone in its daily life, VR and AR will definitely change a lot of things for them. Among other things, it will allow users to experience a diverse reality based on peculiar needs and wants.</p>
      <h3>DO VIRTUAL REALITY AFFECT SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS?</h3>
      <p>With a growing concern about how digital technologies affect personal relationships, it is assumed that the emergence of virtual and augmented reality could make things even worse. But is that perception correct?
      On the one hand, it is undeniable that phones, social networks, and online communities push people to online interaction. Consequently, diluting face to face human interaction little by little. However, virtual and augmented reality does not have to cause the same effect. Remember my article 11 misconceptions about VR? The exciting thing about these technologies is that they can be so real that they create new social interactions. Face to face, interactive, multichannel, and real-time social communications.</p>
      <h3>SOCIAL FIELDS THAT VIRTUAL REALITY HAS ALREADY INFLUENCED</h3>
      <p>Virtual and augmented reality will have a significant impact in the fields of advertising and marketing. Also, the automotive world is preparing for a significant change. Indeed, for drivers and passengers, the system of navigation will be integrated into their mobile phones. And automakers already have in progress the creation of windshields enabled for augmented reality. The objective is to allow the driver to navigate without taking the eyes aside from the road.</p>
