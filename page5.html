      <h3>Medical Usage</h3>
      <p>Virtual Reality started its fascinating take-over of healthcare for the greatest pleasure of patients and doctors alike. Here are five great examples of medical VR transforming patient lives and how doctors work.
Did you know that it is possible to swim with whales in the ocean while lying in a hospital bed? Have you imagined experiencing your 74th birthday as a 20-something? Perhaps follow a risky surgery from your couch?

Medical VR is an area with fascinating possibilities. It has not just moved the imagination of science-fiction fans, but also clinical researchers and real-life medical practitioners. Although the field is relatively new, there are increasingly great examples of VR having a positive effect on patients’ lives and physicians’ work.</p>
  <h3>Military Training Use</h3>
  <p>VR in defence and security is mainly used to improve the training of soldiers and officers and for the simulation of military missions and operations. The use of VR in military training has several benefits. First of all, it proves to be a viable, cost-effective alternative despite national military budget cuts (Lele, 2013). Indeed, virtual training, unlike live training, does not require the use of real munitions and resources. Moreover, VR can simulate any kind of training, re-creating different environments. Therefore, specific training can be carried out at any time thanks to detailed reconstruction and the high number of possible combinations offered by VR. To understand the value of the wide range of VR simulations, it is sufficient to imagine of all those military situations that would be expensive and difficult to reproduce in actual training with real equipment and that are instead easily made possible in virtual training. </p>
  <h3>Virtual Reality Gaming</h3>
  <p>VR gaming has been dreamed about almost as long as video games -- and especially 3D games -- have existed. Prior to the development of compact technology, VR gaming used projector rooms or multiple screens. VR gaming control may involve a standard keyboard and mouse, game controllers or motion capture methods. More complex VR rooms may include treadmill floors or similar methods to further the user’s sense of freedom of movement and feelings of immersion within the virtual environment. In other VR gaming setups, the user may be confined to a limited area surrounding a computer but have free range of motion within the area.

As technology progresses, virtual reality gaming hardware has matured to the point that VR headsets offer a great exerience with little lag or nausea, two areas that had presented problems historically. Some VR headsets on the market include HTC Vive, Occulus Rift, Microsoft Hololens, Samsung VR, PlayStation VR and Google Cardboard. Most of these offer motion sensing controllers and a tracker to work in concert with the headset. Some offer room-scale VR capabilities while others are designed to be used in a seated or stationary position. In addition to entertainment, VR games can be used for various types of training and for virtual reality therapy.</p>
  <h3>Tourism</h3>
  <p>Imagine being able to try your holiday before you buy it. That’s exactly what the future could hold. The industry is taking the first steps to enabling you to go on guided virtual tours of hotels, restaurants and tourist landmarks.

Thomas Cook launched their 'Try Before You Fly' VR experience in 2015, where potential holidaymakers visit stores in various countries to experience the holiday in VR before booking it. There was a 190% uplift in New York excursions bookings after people tried the 5 minute version of the holiday in VR.

Google Expeditions is another way tourism can become more accessible. Users can travel the world from the comfort of their own home, allowing people of all ages and backgrounds to explore coral reefs or the surface of Mars.</p>
  <h3>Real estate</h3>
  <p>You can look round properties from the comfort of your [existing] home - no estate agent or sacrificing your weekend needed. This allows people to explore houses online and then only view the ones you’re most likely to love in person. Matterport are leading the way and have already scanned thousands of homes using their scanning hardware.</p>

  <h3>Architecture</h3>
  <p>VR is gradually changing the way that architects design and experiment with their work. VR makes it possible to see not just what a building or space will look like but how it will feel. For home-owners, they can experience the space before it is physically built and make real-time changes, which saves the customer and the architect time and money (as well as increasing satisfaction on completion of the project).

Architects have been using 3D models for years but using immersive tools such as Iris VR allows them to understand and explore the space at the deepest level possible.</p>
