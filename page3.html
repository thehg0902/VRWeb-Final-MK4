      <h3>How technology revolutionizes political campaigning</h3>
      <p>Political parties have been known to employ disruptive methodologies and strategies to influence people. Modern technologies and communication mediums are rapidly transforming the way political campaigns are carried out. With the assistance of varied external influences or marketing efforts, such as using social media, the rate of adoption of new ideas can be accelerated. Who can forget the impact of Facebook on the Obama campaign? It was the first major instance of social media utilized for political campaigning. With its success, political parties and leaders started paying attention to build their social media following.</p>

      <h3>Social Media Involvement</h3>
      <p>With the increasing adoption of social media, its misuse has also become rampant. The Cambridge Analytica scandal brought forward the alarming issue of how manipulation through social media can be done to achieve political gains. Its disruptive campaigning spread all over the world, and among the most popular campaigns by this firm was the Brexit campaign, which they still deny any wrongdoing within.</p>

      <h3>Application in Political Campaigning</h3>
      <p>Augmented reality is one of the technologies that has been specific to one industry, the gaming industry. However, it has now been adopted by other industries, too. Mobile app development companies are now coming up with a wide range of AR-enabled mobile apps to serve the needs of people. Along with gaming, it is swiftly gaining traction in travel, entertainment, healthcare, etc.

Augmented reality can be efficiently utilized to inform people about various issues in a highly interactive way. For instance, a political party can create an AR-enabled mobile app that shows location-based data such as crime data, development information and indices as a timeline reflecting development done over time during a particular elected officialâ€™s tenure.</p>

    <h3>Spreading Contentious Issues</h3>
    <p>Augmented reality can be used to make people aware of contentious issues. The number of undocumented immigrants in a region, crimes committed by them, money spent on the welfare of undocumented immigrants, drug use within these communities and more can be showcased through an augmented reality app. This can influence local people and make them more vocal and volatile. These contentious issues can polarize people, and political parties can take advantage of that.

Fanning these flames with one-sided information can cause immense harm. But imagine the impact of such an app in highlighting the actual effect of the U.S.-Mexico border crisis, European countries facing immigration crises and growing religious intolerance in Asia, especially in countries like Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, etc.</p>
