      <h3>Minorities</h3>
      <p>Minorities are more likely than whites to be passionate about virtual reality. And despite the attention paid to Facebook-owned Oculus in the media, Sony’s PlayStation VR is the most recognized brand.

  These are some of the conclusions from a wide-ranging survey of consumer expectations and preferences about virtual reality that will be released Tuesday by Greenlight VR, a virtual reality analysis and research firm, and Touchstone Research, which conducts online market studies. Fast Company was given exclusive advance access to the data.</p>
      <h3>Afordability</h3>
      <p>The study, which looked in depth at consumers’ purchase intent, focused much of its attention on how much people are willing to pay for virtual reality systems. That’s vital, as the report contends that price is the top factor in determining whether someone will purchase a VR system in 2016.</p>
      <h3>General Interests</h3>
      <p>There are many categories of VR content. Topping our interest across all age, gender, and ethnicity groups are travel and exploration categories, which 37% of the report’s respondents said they wanted to do. Gaming was next, at 33%, followed by shopping, at 10%. Just 4% said they want to watch movies or TV in virtual reality.However, 66% of those surveyed also said they were definitely or probably willing to try all forms of interactive entertainment, which includes TV, movies, and other video experiences. Travel and tourism content also garnered the interest of 66% of respondents. And 60% said they were interested in trying VR gaming.</p>
